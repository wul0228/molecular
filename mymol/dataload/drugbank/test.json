  "metabolism": "Lepirudin is thought to be metabolized by release of amino acids via catabolic hydrolysis of the parent drug. However, con-clusive data are not available.

  "pharmacodynamics": "Lepirudin is used to break up clots and to reduce thrombocytopenia. It binds to thrombin and prevents thrombus or clot formation. It is a highly potent, selective, and essentially irreversible inhibitor of thrombin and clot-bond thrombin. Lepirudin requires no cofactor for its anticoagulant action. Lepirudin is a recombinant form of hirudin, an endogenous anticoagulant found in medicinal leeches.", 
  "description": "Lepirudin is identical to natural hirudin except for substitution of leucine for isoleucine at the N-terminal end of the molecule and the absence of a sulfate group on the tyrosine at position 63. It is produced via yeast cells. Bayer ceased the production of lepirudin (Refludan) effective May 31, 2012.",
